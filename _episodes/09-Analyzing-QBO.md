# Introduction
QBO

<img src="../fig/ssw_nh.png" width=600>(Krüger, 2002: UiO lecture slides)

# Research question ideas
1. Frequency and timing of NH major SSWs: modelled versus observed
2. Major SSWs in the SH in present and future?
3. Impact of major SSWs on the surface climate?

# Data
NorESM2 daily [ta, ua, zg], FUB dataset
